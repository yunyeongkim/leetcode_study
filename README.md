## **Study Format**

- **Platform**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) (Focus: Easy & Medium problems)
- **Frequency**: Weekly Google Meet sessions  
- **Session Agenda**: Analyze and discuss 2 algorithm problems per meeting

---

## **How to Prepare for the Study**

### **1. Problem Preparation**
For each session, select **1-2 algorithm problems** and prepare the following:

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Clearly interpret the problem.
   - Define the requirements and objectives of the problem.

2. **First Code Submission**
   - Share the initial solution you wrote (even if it’s incorrect).
   - Include the **time taken** to come up with this solution.

3. **First Code Analysis**
   - Analyze your initial code.
   - Focus on the **time complexity (Big O)** and the **data structures** used.

4. **Optimized Solution**
   - If the First Code is not optimal, use **LeetCode's explanation** as a reference.
   - Highlight the issues with the First Code and explain how the optimized solution resolves these issues.

---

### **2. Visual Materials**
- Prepare **visual aids** to explain your approach (e.g., flowcharts, diagrams, pseudocode).
- Tools like **Obsidian** or basic **drawing tools** (e.g., Paint) are encouraged.

---

### **3. Presentation Guidelines**
- Keep your presentation under **15 minutes**.
- Focus on clarity, structure, and providing insights into your problem-solving process.

---

## **Feedback & Discussion**

### **1. Feedback after Presentations**
- After each presentation, allocate **5 minutes** for group feedback.
- Feedback can include:
  - Code quality and readability
  - Alternative approaches
  - General improvement suggestions

### **2. Open Discussion**
- Feedback doesn’t have to be strictly about the code.
  - Feel free to discuss new **algorithm concepts**, **English terminology**, or **problem-solving techniques**.
- Positive reinforcement is encouraged! Highlight what the presenter did well. 🌟
- Feel free to ask questions about the approach or problem-solving methodology.
