I attempted to refactor the working `chatgpt_answer` function into a more readable version, but I ended up with an incorrect implementation. The original function works correctly, while the refactored version does not.

The issue lies in how I split the logic into two separate loops. In the first function, the prefix sum map (`prefixSumCount`) is updated during the same iteration that checks for valid subarrays. This ensures that only the prefix sums up to the current index are considered.

However, in my refactored version, I first populate the `prefixSumCount` map in a separate loop, then use it in the second loop to count subarrays. The problem with this approach is that the map now includes prefix sums from the entire array, including those that occur after the current index. This incorrectly allows subarrays that end in the future to be counted, leading to an overcount.

Lesson learned: refactoring can inadvertently change the logic and behavior of a program. Always test and validate your refactored code to ensure it still produces the correct results.
