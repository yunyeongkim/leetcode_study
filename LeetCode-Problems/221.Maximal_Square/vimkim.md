This problem was quite challenging.

Initially, I attempted to precompute the lengths of continuous sequences of 1s, but that approach was insufficient.

```python
DEBUG = False

def vimkim(*a, **ka):
if DEBUG:
print(*a, **ka)

class Solution:
def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        N = len(matrix)
        M = len(matrix[0])

        ### Stage 1: Precompute the sequences length

        # how many 1s above
        matUp = [[0 for _ in range(M+1)] for _ in range(N+1)]
        # how many 1s in the left direction
        matLeft = [[0 for _ in range(M+1)] for _ in range(N+1)]

        for i in range(1, N+1):
            for j in range(1, M+1):

                if matrix[i-1][j-1] == "1":
                    matUp[i][j] = matUp[i-1][j] + 1
                    matLeft[i][j] = matLeft[i][j-1] + 1

        vimkim("matUp")
        vimkim(*matUp, sep='\n')
        vimkim("matLeft")
        vimkim(*matLeft, sep='\n')

        ### Stage 2: calculate the area on the i-1, j-1 position
        ### so that we can expand

        memo = [[0 for _ in range(M+1)] for _ in range(N+1)]

        max_ = 0

        for i in range(1, N+1):
            for j in range(1, M+1):
                if matrix[i-1][j-1] == "1":
                    memo[i][j] = min(
                        matLeft[i][j],
                        matUp[i][j],
                        memo[i-1][j-1] + 1
                    )
                    max_ = max(max_, memo[i][j])


        vimkim("memo")
        vimkim(*memo, sep='\n')
        return max_ * max_

```

This solution precomputes the count of consecutive 1s above and to the left of each cell to speed up the dynamic programming (DP) step, allowing it to efficiently determine the maximum square size.

However, I came across a much more elegant solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0

        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])

        dp = [[0] * (cols + 1) for _ in range(rows + 1)]
        max_side = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == '1':
                    dp[r+1][c+1] = min(dp[r][c], dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1]) + 1  # Be careful with indexing
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[r+1][c+1])

        return max_side * max_side

```

This alternative approach simplifies the problem by using a single DP table to track the maximum square size ending at each cell, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. It efficiently calculates the maximum square by checking the minimum of the top, left, and top-left neighbors, then adds one if the current cell is 1.

The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity and effectiveness, eliminating the need for separate precomputation steps.
