> A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

### Understanding Binary and Binary Clock (*Hour explain*)

- In binary, each bit represents a power of 2.
- "2 bits" can represent values from 0 to 3.
  - Bit weights: 2¹ (2), 2⁰ (1)

#### Example (2 bits)
| Binary | Calculation | Decimal |
| :----: | :---------: | :-----: |
|   00   |      0      |    0    |
|   01   |      1      |    1    |
|   10   |      2      |    2    |
|   11   |  2 + 1 = 3  |    3    |

- Extending to "4 bits":
  - Bit weights: 2³ (8), 2² (4), 2¹ (2), 2⁰ (1)
  - Values range from 0 to 15.

#### Example (4 bits)
| Binary |  Calculation   | Decimal |
| :----: | :------------: | :-----: |
|  0001  |       1        |    1    |
|  0010  |       2        |    2    |
|  0100  |       4        |    4    |
|  1000  |       8        |    8    |
|  1010  |   8 + 2 = 10   |   10    |
|  1101  | 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 |   13    |

- **Why 8, 4, 2, 1?**
  - Each bit position follows powers of 2.
  - By turning ON specific bits (1), their corresponding weights are summed to form the decimal number.
  - Turning bits ON or OFF is a structured way to uniquely represent any number without overlap.

```math
Decimal  Binary   8 4 2 1
---------------------------
0        0000    - - - -
1        0001    - - - O
2        0010    - - O -
3        0011    - - O O
4        0100    - O - -
5        0101    - O - O
6        0110    - O O -
7        0111    - O O O
8        1000    O - - -
9        1001    O - - O
10       1010    O - O -
11       1011    O - O O
12       1100    O O - -
13       1101    O O - O
14       1110    O O O -
15       1111    O O O O
```
#### Key Insight
> Binary is not random ON/OFF switching.  
> Each bit represents a specific power of 2.  
> Memorizing **8, 4, 2, 1** makes it easy to read and build binary numbers.

#### Summary
> **Binary is a system where each bit carries a specific weight based on powers of 2, allowing any number to be precisely created by turning bits ON (1) or OFF (0).**


### Understanding Binary and the Binary Clock (Minute Explanation)

- As we discussed, **4 bits** can represent numbers from **0 to 15**.
- However, to represent **minutes** (which go up to **59**), we need to reach at least **60**.
- Therefore, we use **6 bits**, because 26=642^6 = 6426=64.
    - This allows us to represent numbers from **0 to 63**.

#### 6 bits for Minutes

The 6 bits correspond to:

| Bit Position | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 1st          | 32    |
| 2nd          | 16    |
| 3rd          | 8     |
| 4th          | 4     |
| 5th          | 2     |
| 6th          | 1     |
#### Examples
Binary representation of each key value:

| Decimal | Binary   |
| ------- | -------- |
| 32      | `100000` |
| 16      | `010000` |
| 8       | `001000` |
| 4       | `000100` |
| 2       | `000010` |
| 1       | `000001` |
